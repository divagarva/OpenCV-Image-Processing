# OpenCV-Image-Processing
 This Python project demonstrates basic image processing using OpenCV (`cv2`). It includes converting an image to grayscale, resizing it, and applying Canny edge detection. Users can load an image, process it, and view the results in real-time, providing a foundation for advanced image processing tasks.
